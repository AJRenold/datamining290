Exploring data from the Kaggle.com Event Recommendation Engine Challenge

Found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/event-recommendation-engine-challenge/data

This is a data mining competition to produce an event recommendation engine which predictions which events a user will be interested in. There are five data files for the competition:

1. train.csv
2. users.csv
3. user_friends.csv
4. events.csv
5. event_attendees.csv

To better understand each dataset, I used the python library Pandas and read each csv into a DataFrame. I then used the DataFrame.column.describe() and DataFrame.column.value_counts() to export the data in each csv file. Below I've written an analysis and pasted output from describe() and value_counts()

1. train.csv is training data for a model produced as a solution to the challenge. It can be used as a learning data and testing data when developing a solution to the challenge.

2. users.csv is a users table with 38209 records. The Location column has an very interesting distribution with the top 3 values of Medan, Yogyakarta, and Phnom Penh. Other columns that could be valuable wither further analysis were Birthyear, Locale, and Gender.

LOCALE top 5 values
en_US    17073
id_ID    11817
es_LA     1999
en_GB     1745
es_ES      981

BIRTHYEAR top 5 values

*None has 1492 values

3. user_friends.csv is a table of users and a list of the user's friends. I sampled the data to find user_ids in friends list, which would show users might be friends with other users and found no examples. Using describe() and value_counts() was not effect with Friends because each value was stored as a list of user_ids. I used collections.Counter to count the values. Interesting I found that none of the top 5 user_ids appeared in the users.csv file, suggesting my conclusion is correct.

FRIENDS top 5 values
[('119202013', 339), ('2236096129', 162), ('3260725213', 158), ('2928879570', 158), ('726297374', 154)]
* had to use collections.Counter to find this because friends were stored as lists of user_ids


4. events.csv is a table of events. Interesting the events table has 3137972 events, significantly more than the number of records in the users table. The events table has very granular location information, with the Country, State, City, ZIp, Lat, Lng values available for events. Only 1806092 events have lat and lng values. events also has many columns called c_1, c_2, c_3, etc that relate to n-gram of words in the event description.

CITY top 5 values
New York         43009
Toronto          32023
Los Angeles      27831
Chicago          21390
London           21187

5. event_attendees.csv is a table of 24144 event records with lists of invited users respond yes, no, or maybe to the event. I sampled a few of the user_ids and not all are found in the Users Table.
