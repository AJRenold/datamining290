Question 8 Put the following steps for building a classifier in the correct chronological order:

My answer:
1. Prepare Training Data
5. Set aside hold-out set
2. teach classifier
7. verification with testing data
6. save model parameters
4. input unlabeled new data into model
3. output guesses on new data

Correct answer:
1.
5.
2.
6. save model parameters
7. verification with testing data
4.
3.

Explaination for the difference between answers: I interpreted the steps differently as after the training
or teaching of a classifier, you would save the model parameters, only once you've verified the model. The
correct answer suggests that you must save model parameters before you can verify the model with testing
data.

Question 11 Fixing gradient descent

My answer: The error function is increasing with each iterations meaning the increment in slope for each
iteration is changing in the wrong direction. You should revers the change in slope function so that the 
error decreases with each step, indicating a better fit.

Correct answer: My answer might be pointing out a bug in the implementation, but the prompt indicates that
we should assume there are no bugs in the implementation. If there are no bugs, then the correct answer is
that the size of the step function is too large and that the program is stepping over the solution and
finding a larger and larger error. This can be vizualized as the error point bouncing out of the parabola 
graphing the error function.
